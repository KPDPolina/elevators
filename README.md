Tow elevators with ui.

Conditions:
- The house has (16 floors) 2 passenger elevators and 1 call button on each floor
- Come up with a small visual UI (counter) that will visually show which elevator is moving in which direction and on what floor the elevator is currently located
- By pressing the call button, calculate which elevator will arrive faster (2 elevators can simultaneously go up and even to the same floor, one elevator can also go down and the other up, and the user called it in the middle)
